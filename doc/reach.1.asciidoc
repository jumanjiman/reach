reach(1)
========

NAME
----
reach - wrapper around the `ping` command


SYNOPSIS
--------
reach 'hostname' | 'ip'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `reach` command is a simple wrapper around `ping` and `ping6`.
`reach` has a configuration file to adjust its behavior. Benefits:

* Check exit status to determine reachability of a host or IP.
The exit status of `ping` or `ping6` is passed through
as the exit status of `reach`. 
* No output to `/dev/stdout`
* Errors go to `/dev/stderr`
* Reduces complexity of other scripts



OPTIONS
-------
None.



ENVIRONMENT
-----------
PING_TMOUT::
The number of seconds to wait for a response
from the target host.


EXAMPLE
-------

----
for x in $(seq 1 5); do
  echo -n "server${x}.example.com: "
  reach server${x}.example.com || { echo; continue; }
  ssh server${x}.example.com "uptime"
done
